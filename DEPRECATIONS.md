# Deprecation information

## Awaiting on `request_default_bus_name`

By mistake `request_default_bus_name` was made in to async function
even though it was never documented to be one. It is now a blocking
function but returns an awaitable for backwards compatibility.

* **Since**: 0.11.0
* **Warning**: 0.11.0
* **Removed**: 0.14.0
